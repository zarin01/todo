# REACT TODO LIST

Today we worked on creating a todo list and after creating it we added our own styling.

# WHAT I CHANGED

I ened up adding all the files into my one js file because I was having issues importing, so if you go through the code the remove button is inside app js, i also addeed a line to go throught the text when you click complete, and finally i changed the buttons and the background colors.

# HOW TO RUN

I created this on React 17.0 so to create this I installed react 17 by adding npm install react@17.0.0 react-dom@17.0.0 before i create the react app, after that I just need to change the JSON to say version 17. After add the files into the existing app and css file and then your all set up!
